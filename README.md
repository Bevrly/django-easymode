Easymode, Quickly build backends for flash/flex websites with django
====================================================================

With easymode you can create backends for dynamic flash/flex websites.
Easymode makes internationalization simple and outputs xml by
default. To tailor the xml to your application, you can transform
it using xslt templates, which easymode integrates.
