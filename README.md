Easymode : toolkit for making xml based flash websites
======================================================

With easymode you can create backends for dynamic flash/flex websites.
Easymode makes internationalization simple and outputs xml by
default. To tailor the xml to your application, you can transform
it using xslt templates, which easymode integrates.
